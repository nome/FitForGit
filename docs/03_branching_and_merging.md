Branching and Merging
=====================

Merge conflicts
---------------

Git merges histories of the entire repository; until _all_ conflicts are
resolved and committed, the merge is "in progress" for all files.

<ul class="hints">
<li>You can abort a merge in progress with <code>git merge --abort</code></li>
</ul>
